intro: |
    I am currently an Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) Officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assigned to the Hawaii State Department of Health, and a Scientist Officer in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.

    My prior training includes a PhD in Epidemiology from the University of Washington, a MPH in Epidemiology and Applied Biostatistics from Columbia University, and a BSc in Health Geography and Economics from McGill University. As a naturally curious individual, I have worked in various capacities on a wide spectrum of research topics: chemistry, biochemistry, scientific communication, global health security, agricultural nutrient cycling, food insecurity, disaster preparedness, cancer epidemiology, and infectious disease epidemiology. 

     Through my work, I aim to leverage my rigorous epidemiological, biostatistics, and environmental health training to reduce the burden of disease across diverse populations and to increase community access to resources (e.g., health care, medication, food, and other basic needs) in an equitable way.
