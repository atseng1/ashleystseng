Increasing community access to basic needs (such as food and health care) is what inspired me to embark on a career in public health. From the research side, I have analyzed data specific to Washington State to 1) examine the association between health care access and food insecurity among lower-income older adults and 2) monitor the economic impact of COVID-19 and related inflationary food price fluctuations on Washington State residents’ food security and needs. In addition to my past research work, I also have more than a decade of experience volunteering for various hunger relief programs (the Salvation Army of Baltimore, Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine and Xavier Mission of New York City, and Ballard Food Bank of Seattle).
