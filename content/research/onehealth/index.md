Utilizing a One Health approach, I have used various epidemiological, biostatistics, and bioinformatics applications to study infectious diseases. After undergrad, I was an Epidemiology Student Trainee at the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service (NPS). At the NPS, I worked on developing content (e.g., infectious disease fact sheets) for the NPS internal and external websites, evaluating the Appalachian Trailâ€™s current norovirus surveillance system to identify strengths and gaps, using CDC software EpiInfo to develop and deploy a disease detection survey for norovirus cases in Yellowstone National Park, and performing fieldwork (tick dragging) for a multi-year CDC Lyme disease surveillance project in Rock Creek Park, Maryland. For my Master of Public Health (MPH) in Epidemiology practicum, I interned at EcoHealth Alliance with the Western Asia Bat Research Network Project (WAB-Net), during which I collected diagnostic samples from wild-caught bats for coronavirus surveillance in Turkey and Jordan and conducted a network analysis on livestock trade and prevalence of three zoonotic diseases between 20 Western Asia countries in R. After the practicum concluded, I transitioned the network analysis to become my MPH in Epidemiology Thesis, which was submitted upon my graduation in May 2020. Most recently, as a U.S. National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Predoctoral Fellow (NIH T32ES015459) from 2020-2022, I worked with Drs. Peter Rabinowitz, Marilyn Roberts, and Scott Weissman at the University of Washington on characterizing the diversity of sequence types through phylogenetics and the co-occurrence of heavy metal resistance genes and antibiotic resistance genes of public health relevance through bioinformatics in *Escherichia coli* isolates from marine mammal and water sources in the Salish Sea ecosystem.
