description: I have a diverse research background with experiences in I have pursued research in chemistry, biochemistry, scientific communication, biosecurity, agricultural nutrient cycling, disaster preparedness, cancer epidemiology, and infectious disease epidemiology. My research interests lie at the intersection of infectious disease epidemiology, epidemic preparedness, and community health. I am interested in utilizing data science, bioinformatics, spatial analyses, and advanced epidemiological methods to translate data into something useful for and actionable to public health. While at University of Washington, my research has involved implementing advanced biostatistical and epidemiological analyses, learning the whole genome sequencing pipeline to perform bioinformatic analyses of viral and bacterial sequences, and forging pathways to increase community healthcare access.
